### welcome to the documentation/overview of features on psp's minecraft server 
the server will be a **vanilla-focussed** server, running on the currently latest version of 1.21.8.  
though, please note that ANY 1.21 based client will be able to join the server.

## __plugin overview__

    - this plugin will be mostly used as the general suite of commands
- **RemmyChat** (Chat)
    - this plugin is fully going to power anything chat-related, including messages, general chatting and whatnot
- **Maquillage** (Chat/Cosmetics)
    - this will allow you guys to set any pre-defined tag, consisting of a list of our favourite 7tv emotes
- **TAB** (Cosmetic/Misc.)
    - lets us do with the tablist what we're doing to make it look clean
- **TwitchLiveAnnouncer** (Misc.)
    - this is simply there to complete the tablist design, adding an indicator whenever psp guy is live
- **LuckPerms** (Misc.)
    - adding ranks/groups to ensure that everyone has the perms they need and nothing more
- **ImageFrame** (Fun)
    - lets people create images of their liking (the industrial revolution..)  with a map in their hand

    - lets the mods/admins track whenever anyone decides to be an idiot, roll it back and ban them
